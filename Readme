Project is designed using java selenium cucumber maven
POM (Page Object Model) is used to manage the test structure easily.
Using cucumber reporting to log the results.
I used Scenario outline to test all of the web drivers and we can search different words by using scenario outline structure.
I used assertions to verify the elements
In addition, I added different cucumber sentences to manage the web drivers.
If driver is not supported in PC, fail message is shown.
